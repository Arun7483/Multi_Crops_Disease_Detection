# Multi_Crops_Disease_Detection
Java, Python, and Machine Learning program to display a Multi-Crops Disease Detection
# 🌾 Multi-Crop Disease Detection using YOLO-based AI

**Project Duration:** [Mar 2025 – Present]  
**Supervisor:** [Ambresh B]

## 📌 Overview

This project develops a real-time AI model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for detecting diseases in multiple crop types. The system enables early disease identification to improve crop management and increase yield. It combines deep learning with computer vision for efficient, automated detection in agricultural fields.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Ultralytics YOLOv8  
- OpenCV  
- PyTorch  
- LabelImg (for image annotation)  
- Jupyter Lab (model training)  
- Java (application development)  
- SQL (backend database)

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Imported datasets from Kaggle, Roboflow, and added custom images to create a comprehensive multi-crop disease dataset.  
2. Performed image annotation using the LabelImg tool to generate bounding boxes for disease regions.  
3. Trained the YOLOv8 model using Jupyter Lab with the annotated dataset.  
4. Evaluated the model’s accuracy and performance metrics.  
5. Developed a Java application with SQL backend to interface with the trained model for real-time disease detection and management.
